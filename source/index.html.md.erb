# Introduction

This is REST API documentation for the Department for Education’s new "Apply for postgraduate teacher training" service.

Apply will replace the online UCAS application form for postgraduate teacher training. All vendors of student record systems and some training providers will need to make changes to integrate with Apply.

The API is a work in progress. We are publishing draft documentation so that:

- providers and vendors have all the information they need to plan a transition to the new service
- the Apply team can better understand providers’ and vendors’ needs for the API

## What this API is for

Once a candidate has submitted their application via the Apply service, the
application will become available over the API.

Providers can then use the API for:

- reviewing applications
- retrieving candidate application data
- making offers to candidates
- confirming a candidate's place on a course
- rejecting unsuccessful applications

To get an idea of how the API works, we recommend you [review the example usage scenarios](/usage-scenarios).

## Codes and reference data

Before each application cycle, UCAS provides vendors with reference data defining how certain values appear in API responses.

DfE Apply will avoid prioprietary codes wherever possible, preferring existing data formats such as ISO-certified standards or HESA codes.

Codes appear in three contexts:

- All dates in in the API specification are intended to be [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) compliant
- Nationality is expressed as an [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) country code
- Disability is expressed as a [HESA Disability type code](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/student/datafutures/a/disability_disability)

## How do I connect to this API?

**This is a working draft specification**.

We are currently building the service. The API has not yet been implemented.

We're working with all vendors on timelines for integration. As part of this, we'll make private testing environments available.
