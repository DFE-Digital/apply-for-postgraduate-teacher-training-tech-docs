# Introduction

This is REST API documentation for the Department for Education’s new "Apply for postgraduate teacher training" service.

Apply will replace the online UCAS application form for postgraduate teacher training. All vendors of student record systems and some training providers will need to make changes to integrate with Apply.

The API is a work in progress. We are publishing draft documentation so that

- providers and vendors have all the information they need to plan a transition to the new service
- the Apply team can better understand providers’ and vendors’ needs for the API

## What this API is for

- retrieving candidate application data
- inviting candidates to interview
- making (or amending) offers to candidates
- rejecting unsuccessful applications

## How do I connect to this API?

**This is a working draft specification**.

We are currently building the service. The API has not yet been implemented.

Testing environments for each vendor will be available before the service moves into public beta.
