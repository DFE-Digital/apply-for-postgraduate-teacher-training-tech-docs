# Usage scenarios

The examples on this page show typical request URLs and payloads clients can
use to take actions via this API. The examples are only concerned with business
logic and contain no details necessary for real-world usage. For example,
authentication is completely left out.

At the beginning of each scenario, a candidate has completed an application for initial teacher training via the Apply service and that application is available via the API.

The provider has authenticated to your system and begins their work by retrieving all the applications since a given date. Your system issues the following request on their behalf:

```
GET /applications?since=2019-01-10
```

This returns a list of <%= link_to_resource_definition('Application') %>s.

## A successful application (3 steps)

**1. The provider invites the candidate to interview.**

`POST /applications/abc-123/interview`


```json
<%= interview_json %>
```

The interview goes well. The provider would like to offer the candidate a conditional place.

**2. The provider makes an offer**

`POST /applications/abc-123/offer`

```json
<%= offer_json %>
```

The candidate goes on to meet the provider’s conditions. The provider indicates that the candidate has a place.

**3. The provider confirms the candidate’s place**

`POST /applications/abc-123/placement`

```json
<%= placement_json %>
```

## An unsuccessful application (3 steps)

**1. The provider invites the candidate to interview.**

`POST /applications/abc-123/interview`

```json
<%= interview_json %>
```

**2. The provider makes an offer**

The interview went well. The provider would like to offer the candidate a conditional place.

`POST /applications/abc-123/offer`

```json
<%= offer_json %>
```

**3. The provider rejects the candidate**

The candidate did not meet the provider’s conditions. The provider rejects them.

`POST /applications/abc-123/rejection`

```json
<%= rejection_json %>
```

## Rejecting an application (1 step)

**1. The provider reviews the form and rejects the candidate without an interview**

`POST /applications/abc-123/rejection`

```json
<%= rejection_json %>
```
