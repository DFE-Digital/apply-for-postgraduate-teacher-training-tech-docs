# Usage scenarios

The scenarios on this page show example request URLs and payloads clients can
use to take actions via this API. The examples are only concerned with business
logic and are missing details necessary for real-world usage. For example,
authentication is completely left out.

At the beginning of each scenario, a candidate has completed an application for initial teacher training via the Apply service and that application is available via the API.

The provider has authenticated to your system and begins their work by retrieving all the applications since a given date. Your system issues the following request on their behalf:

```
GET /applications?since=2019-01-10
```

This returns a list of <%= link_to_resource_definition('Application') %>s.

The following examples all refer to a single application id, `abc-123`, which
we assume belongs to one of the applications in that list.

## A successful application (3 steps)

**1. The provider invites the candidate to interview.**

`POST /applications/abc-123/interview`

**2. The provider makes an offer**

The interview goes well. The provider would like to offer the candidate a conditional place.

`POST /applications/abc-123/offer`

```json
<%= offer_json %>
```
## An unsuccessful application (3 steps)

**1. The provider invites the candidate to interview.**

`POST /applications/abc-123/interview`

**2. The provider makes an offer**

The interview went well. The provider would like to offer the candidate a conditional place.

`POST /applications/abc-123/offer`

```json
<%= offer_json %>
```

**3. The provider rejects the candidate**

The candidate did not meet the providerâ€™s conditions. The provider rejects them.

`POST /applications/abc-123/rejection`

```json
<%= rejection_json %>
```

## Rejecting an application (1 step)

**1. The provider reviews the form and rejects the candidate without an interview**

`POST /applications/abc-123/rejection`

```json
<%= rejection_json %>
```
