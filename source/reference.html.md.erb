# API reference

**The OpenAPI spec from which this documentation is generated is [available in YAML format](/openapi-spec.yml).**

## Rate limits

You are limited to 120 requests per minute. 

This limit is calculated on a rolling basis, per API key. 
If you exceed the limit, you will get a `429` error `RateLimitError`.

## Authentication

All requests must be accompanied by an `Authorization` header in the following format:

```
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

Unauthenticated requests will receive an `UnauthorizedResponse` (see below)
with a `401` status code.

## Metadata

Every API call on an unsafe HTTP method such as POST or PUT must include a
`meta` key in the JSON body, containing the timestamp and some attribution
metadata showing who performed the action. The schema for this metadata object
can be found under `TimestampAndAttribution`, below. If this data is not
present the API will return `422` with an appropriate error message.
